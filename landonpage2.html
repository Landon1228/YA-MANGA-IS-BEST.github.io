		<td>SPOILER ALERT FOR WHOLE STORY!Naruto shipuden.Naruto Shippuden is the second series of Naruto anime that follows the titular hero on his quest to become Hokage. Unlike the first series, Naruto is now older and has new teachers to help him through his adventure. At the same time, he faces the biggest threats to the five shinobi nations and must deal with the loss of someone he considers a brother.While the original series was filled with serious issues, Shippuden dialed everything up a notch, thrusting Naruto into a world of war, death, and betrayal. He’s not a kid anymore and the gloves have come off.One of the primary focuses of Shippuden is the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke. Both were outcasts who formed an unlikely bond thanks to their dreams of the future. The need for power was clear, and each set out along with Team 7 member Sakura and teacher Kekashi to reach their goals. Unfortunately, as the original series came to an end, it became clear that each sought power for very different reasons.Where Naruto wanted to earn the love and respect of the village as well as protect his home, Sasuke wanted nothing but vengeance and control. As Shippuden progresses, the two begin to but heads more and more until Saskue finally takes his leave to join the likes of Ochimaru. This distance between the two friends plays a heavy role throughout the series as well as the end. Both are avoiding what must be done, and that building conflict will define the men they are going forward in lifeBoth of the young men actually have a deeper bond that becomes clear nearer to the end of the Shippuden series. They embody the spirits of Indra and Asura, sons of the founder of shinobi. Those two are pit against one another in an eternal war, waiting for the cycle to be broken by two who are strong enough to put their differences aside. The Akatsukinaruto shippuden akatsuki 2The Akatsuki are a band of rogue ninja organized for a specific mission. They have been ordered to collect all nine of the tailed beasts, although throughout most of the anime nobody knows why. It’s clear that each beast possesses enormous power, but the members of the Akatsuki aren’t after the spirits for themselves. Instead, they are collecting them to place in a vessel known as the Gedo Statue.Of course, those that house the tailed beasts, known as the Jinchuriki, are no easy targets. These are well-trained ninja with tons of chakra who have been tasked by their nations to house what are essentially weapons of mass destruction. To stop them, the Akatsuki is made up of the strongest shinobi out there, some of which are quite legendary. There numbers include Sasori, a puppet master of the sands, and Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke’s own brother (to whom he vowed vengeance)Their leader is unknown throughout most of the anime, although it is believed to be the masked man named Tobi. This individual has mysterious powers that allow him to teleport and completely avoid all attacks. He acts as a fool outwardly, but he is clearly very powerful. In fact, it was he who caused the destruction to Konoha Village that led to Naruto becoming a Jinchuriki and the Fourth Hokage’s death.Naruto’s TrainingnarutoWith the Akatsuki becoming more active during Naruto Shippuden, Naruto himself needs more training, especially when it comes to controlling his immense power. Over the course of the series, he has several teachers. His primary ones were Jiraiya (who he lovingly called the Pervy Sage) and Kakashi Hatake. Each one was charged with helping Naruto hone his abilities after his schooling was complete.Through missions given by the Hokage and other special journeys, he was kept away from the prying eyes of the Akatsuki so that he can prepare to do battle with them. Yamato, a ninja imbued with the cells of the First Hokage, is also called in to help with Naruto’s training in order to keep the Nine Tails inside of him at bay.After much time has passed, Jiraiya takes Naruto to Mount Myoboku to learn the arts of the Toad Sage. This is done to give Naruto a better control of chakra, and to help provide discipline for the young, brash ninja. Sasuke’s TrainingnarutoWhile Naruto was undergoing his own special training in order to accomplish his goals, Sasuke was trying to increase his power. Unlike the series protagonist, however, Sasuke was willing to use dark means to do so. This meant turning to Orochimaru.Orochimaru is a member of the legendary Sannin (as is Jiraiya), and a former member of the Akatsuki. He wants nothing more than to find the secret to everlasting life, and is often intrigued by powerful shinobi. This leads him to want to learn from them and add them to his collection.He helps Sasuke tap into his inner power while also trying to warp his mind so he can use him and eventually murder him. Sasuke gets the drop on Lord Orochimaru though, killing him. His training then takes him to more unsavory teachers. Joining the Akatsuki puts him in contact with Madara who promises to show him the Uchiha’s place in the world.Sasuke is a lot smarter than he lets on, though, using each opportunity as a stepping stone for him to find his own understanding of the world and the events that helped mold him. </td>

		<td>SPOILER ALERT FOR WHOLE STORY!My Hero acaedaemiaMankind has developed superpowers known as "Quirks"; this is the power the vast majority possesses, those who do not, are being discriminated against and looked down on. Indeed, villains have the superpower, too and want to rebuild the world for it to look the way they see it. However, a prestigious school known as the The Hero Academy trains its students for them to become heroes and to help those who have less powerful Quirks, or those who do not have them at all, as well as to stand against the plans of the villains. The series focuses on a middle school student Izuku Midoriya, who has no superpowers. Will he be able to become a hero and somehow to contribute to the peace and stability in the world, where the weak is the minority that needs to be defended.The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shape-shifting etc. The 20 percent of mankind who do not possess a power are called "quirkless", and are usually looked down on upon the supernatural community. Academies across the globe train their students to learn to fight crime with their powers. Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without any powers, dreams of being able to become a super hero too, but gets bullied for his unrealistic dreams. One day, his fate changes in an unexpected meeting with the no.1 hero all might, and he is given the chance to become his successor and inherent one for all, a quirk with a dark history, which is passed down from successor to successor, who cultivates it with their own power and passes it on, to defeat it's brother, all for one.</td><td><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/my-hero-academia">My Hero Academia</a></td></tr>

			<td> SPOILER ALERT FOR WHOLE STORY! The story takes place in Taishō-era Japan, where a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art", and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from Wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance. This helps them fight against demonsTanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner after his father's death, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a demon slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death of his family.[5]After two years of strenuous training, Tanjiro takes part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass, officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He begins his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko, who has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally helps him in battle. One of Tanjiro's assignments brings him to Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo, a demon who is free of Muzan's control. Tamayo allies with Tanjiro and begins to develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply her with blood from the Twelve Kizuki, the most powerful demons under Muzan's command.Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an unlikely team. The group soon face off against a member of the Kizuki, but are ultimately outmatched; they are rescued by the Corps and brought back to headquarters. There, the Kamado siblings partake in a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite members, who do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to live. However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance from the demons. Alongside the Hashira and Corps members, Tanjiro takes part in numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki, which they survive by narrow margins. During the fray, it is discovered that Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight, a discovery that makes her the prime target of Muzan, who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being.Kagaya forecasts Muzan's intentions and enacts a strict training regiment of the entire Corps to prepare for the upcoming battle. With the blood samples obtained from the Kizuki, Tamayo develops a serum to cure Nezuko, who is kept isolated far from the battle as she recovers. Muzan soon appears before Kagaya, who triggers a suicide attack to stagger him. The Hashira and Tanjiro ambush Muzan, but he traps them all within Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth which houses the Kizuki. Tamayo restrains Muzan with a poison she concocted, leaving him vulnerable for attack. To reach him, the Corps defeat the remaining Kizuki members, though they take heavy losses of their own. Muzan slays Tamayo by absorbing her but is forced above ground by the Corps. A desperate battle of attrition ensues as the remainder of the Demon Slayer Corps fight against Muzan until the morning sun can kill him. Aided by Tamayo's poison, the Corps succeed, though many are killed, including most of the Hashira, while Tanjiro is mortally wounded. Helpless against the sun, Muzan gives his remaining power to a dying Tanjiro and makes him a demon in a last ditch effort to have his species survive. Tanjiro begins to attack the remaining Corp members, but through the efforts of his allies and Nezuko, who has been fully restored to her human self, he is turned back into a human.In the aftermath of the battle, the Corps are disbanded as the death of Muzan has effectively vanquished all other demons. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their family home, accompanied by Zenitsu and InosukeIn a modern-day epilogue, the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons</td><td><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba">Demon slayer</a></td>
